# Stage 1 — Platform Boundary + Company Foundation

## Work order

1. Backend ADR.
2. API boundary: auth, organization context, projects/runs, typed actions, artifacts, approvals, events, errors, idempotency.
3. Core schema: accounts, organizations, organization_profiles, organization_members, capabilities, organization_capabilities, projects, integration_connections, audit_log.
4. Security tests: cross-tenant read/write, forged organization_id, revoked membership, disabled capability, background-job tenant leakage.

## Definition of Done

- user creates organization;
- company name and account type are required;
- capability pack applied;
- user can switch organizations;
- data never crosses tenants;
- extension authenticates to platform;
- platform returns organization-scoped context;
- audit records organization/user/action;
- tests prove isolation.
